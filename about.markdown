    <h3>About Robert A. Butler, Silversmith</h3>
    <p>Robert A. Butler is a contemporary American silversmith. Butler earned his English Hallmark in 1976, a distinction shared with only a handful of other American silversmiths. Over the course of his 40 year career as an artist and silversmith, Butler has earned numerous distinctions and his artwork is displayed in museums around the world.</p>
    <p>Butler's knowledge of classical silversmithing has informed his artwork, allowing him to use traditional English silversmithing techniques to create modern masterpieces. Butler's beautiful fusion of tradition and modern design is recognized by his pieces that currently reside in the contemporary silver collections of the <a href="http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O137121/fish-slice-butler-robert/" target="_blank">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in London and the <a href="http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/animal-bowl-42191" target="_blank">Boston Museum of fine Arts</a>.</p>
    <p>Most recently Butler has relocated his workshop to the South Beach of Miami, where his modern interpretation of classical silver design has met head-on with the local vibrancy. Butler's silver, which has always blurred the line between modernity and tradition, is finding a new niche in the Miami art community.</p>
